funny story
as one does

[intro]
Once upon a time
In the winter that year
Last week

[drama]
<hero1> got lost and <hero2> took <delay> to find them again
<hero1> got quickly bored and <hero2> was a bit upset they had to leave so early

[delay]
quite a while
many nerve-racking hours

# our modular main story, at last...
# here we create 2 new vars (hero1 & hero2), each initialized with random values
# if multiple values are available for a var, each time a new value is picked,
# we ensure it's different than the last picked value...

<intro>, <hero1=name> and <hero2=name> went to <place> (<remark>). <hero1> did some <activity>, but <hero2> chose <activity> instead. Then, <drama>.

The end.
