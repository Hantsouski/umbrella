## About

{{pkg.description}}

This package uses vanilla JS objects to define component specs for various types
of form elements (various factory functions are provided). These specs can then
be passed to the polymorphic & dynamically extensible
[`compileForm()`](https://docs.thi.ng/umbrella/rdom/functions/compileForm.html)
function to generate the actual form elements/components in hiccup format, which
can then be used with
[thi.ng/rdom](https://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella/tree/develop/packages/rdom) or
for static (or SSR) HTML generation via
[thi.ng/hiccup](https://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella/tree/develop/packages/hiccup).

All generated form elements are unstyled by default, but can be fully customized (in various stages) via user-provided options.

Please see the example project linked further below, which demonstrates all currently provided elements...
