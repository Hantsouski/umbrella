// each line of this file defines a CSS class (or class pattern)
// which will always be included in the resulting CSS, even if
// none of the declarations in the processed *.meta file(s) are
// making use of them. this is needed for classes which are
// only referenced from TS/JS code (and with their IDs possibly
// assembled dynamically...)

// in the case of this example, we only need to ensure the following
// color classes are included...

bg-*
black
